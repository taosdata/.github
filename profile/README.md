[TDengine](https://tdengine.com) is a time-series database designed to help traditional industries overcome the challenges of Industry 4.0 and Industrial IoT. It enables real-time ingestion, storage, analysis, and distribution of petabytes of data per day, generated by billions of sensors and data collectors. By making big data accessible and affordable, TDengine helps everyone — from independent developers and startups to industry stalwarts and multinationals — unlock the true value of their data.

Our mission is to democratize industrial data systems and give people the freedom to use their data however it benefits them most. We are determined to unchain traditional industries from the legacy data infrastructure that has held back digital transformation and move toward a future in which silos are broken down, data is easily centralized and shared, and the benefits of revolutionary technologies like AI are as accessible to the industrial sector as they are to big tech.
